### MovieApp client REST-ful application

MovieApp by client side requires Angular.js to run.
It is the last part of full MEAN API Application.

To proper work of the MovieApp, connection with server side (server and database) has to be established.

### How it works?

For client side, host for:

```sh
index.html
```
has to be added, for example in Apache server.


### Additional

This is the beta-version of full app. Angular dependencies are inline added to index.html, which it has to be improved.
